## QR Code Generator

This QR code generator uses version 4L, 0 level masking and byte mode encoding. 
More versions, EC levels, auto masking as well as encoding modes, might be added in the future if I'm still interested in this :)

## Run
To start the program simply run `go run .` and it will open the browser to visualize and edit the QR code
